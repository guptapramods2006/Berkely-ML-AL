Readme: Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

This repository contains the code and analysis for determining whether a customer will accept a coupon based on various factors. The investigation is performed on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, including information about driving scenarios, customer attributes, contextual attributes, and coupon attributes.

Notebook
The analysis and code are in the Jupyter Notebook file Pramod_coupon.ipynb. The notebook contains well-structured headings and appropriately formatted text to guide you through the analysis process.

Data
The dataset used in this analysis was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It includes information about the customer's gender, age, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, annual income, and other attributes. The dataset also provides details about the driving scenario, such as the driving destination, location of the user, coupon and destination, weather conditions, temperature, time, passenger information, and coupon expiration.

Summary of Findings
Here are some of the key findings from the analysis:

* The proportion of observations accepting the coupon: 56.84%
* The acceptance rate for bar coupons is 41.00%.
* No drivers in the dataset accepted bar coupons based on the specified conditions for different groups (e.g., bar visits, age, occupation).
* These findings suggest that while many customers accept coupons, the acceptance rates vary for different coupon categories. 
* It also highlights that the specific conditions used for grouping and analysis may need to be more applicable or restrictive for certain coupon types.
* For better understanding of data, added  bar plotto calculate the freq of each coupon categories, Calculate the frequency of each gender, Histogram for Temperature Distribution and Scatter Plot for Age vs. Income:
