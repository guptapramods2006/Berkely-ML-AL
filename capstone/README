Vehicle Safety Analysis with ADAS

Overview
========
This Python script aims to analyze vehicle safety, with a specific focus on the impact of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). It incorporates data from various CSV files, including incident data, traffic data, ADAS data, and sensor data. The analysis encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization of key metrics, and the development of a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier.

Prerequisites
=============
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage
=====
Data Loading:
Update the file paths within the script to reflect the location of your CSV files for incident data, traffic data, ADAS data, and sensor data.

Run the Script:
Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
python vehicle_safety_analysis.py

The script will load the data, clean column names, merge datasets, and conduct various analyses.

Explore Results:
The script generates visualizations and prints key metrics related to vehicle safety, the impact of ADAS, road conditions, weather conditions, and more.

Modeling:
The script builds a Random Forest Classifier model to predict accident occurrence based on selected ADAS features. The model is trained, and its performance is evaluated.

Results
=======

Visualizations
--------------

Lane Closure and Incident Severity:
The script generates heatmaps illustrating the correlation between lane closure and incident severity for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Road Conditions and Accident Rate:
Bar plots are created to compare the accident rates based on different road conditions for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Weather Conditions and Accident Rate:
Bar plots demonstrate the relationship between weather conditions and accident rates for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Correlation between Sensors and Traffic Speed:
A heatmap shows the correlation coefficients between various sensors and traffic speed.

Traffic Density and Accident Rate:
Boxplots illustrate the relationship between ADAS activation, traffic density, and accident rates.

Distribution of Incident Severity by ADAS Activation:
A count plot displays the distribution of incident severity for vehicles with and without ADAS.

ADAS Impact Analysis
====================

Accident Rates:
The script calculates and compares accident rates for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Traffic Speed:
Average traffic speeds are compared for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Road Conditions:
The script analyzes and prints road conditions for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Lane Closure and Incident Severity:
The impact of ADAS on incident severity during lane closures is explored.

Weather Conditions and Accident Rates:
Bar plots illustrate how weather conditions correlate with accident rates for vehicles with and without ADAS.

Modeling
=========

Model Building:
The script builds a Random Forest Classifier model to predict accident occurrence based on selected ADAS features.

Model Evaluation:
Model accuracy is calculated and displayed, along with a classification report and confusion matrix.

Binary Target Variable:
The script creates a binary target variable indicating whether an accident occurred or not.
